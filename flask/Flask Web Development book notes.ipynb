    "\n",
    "Could hack if in a hurry and ask for password (or key) as part of incoming json request, and return error if they aren’t on the system\n",

    "PATCH - like PUT in that it changes things, but can change subsets of data rather than updating an entire record\n",
    "\n",
    "curl -v {URL}   …means \"verbose mode please\" and will make curl show its request, the response headers and additional informational details about the transfer performed. Tells you content type (eg: html/json/etc),  and other info\n",

    "Every resource (page, thing, piece of information) should have a unique URL\n",
    "Flask redirects from non-trailing slash urls to trailing slash URLs if it can’t find anything at non-trailing URL, but not vice versa\n",
    "GET = get info (aka the Resource)\n",

    "PUT = modify existing resource\n",

    "XML and JSON are most common API formats (json seems more suited to me)\n",
    "In a well-designed RESTful API, the client just knows a short list of top-level resource URLs and then discovers the rest from links included in responses, similar to how you can discover new web pages while browsing the Web by clicking on links that appear in pages that you know. \n",
